# TRON WALLET & REACT INTEGRATION

![Preview](src/Screenshot.png)


DEMO  - https://wallet-link.ibnz.dev/


This is a React application to fetch and display details from TRON Blockchain wallets (Tronlink, Klever). This should help community developers, who are building decentralised applications, to establish a link and communication with Tron Blockchain.

## Community coders, please commit

Feel free to add extra functions or improvements, this helps me to familiarise myself with source control and open source project managing. By contributing, you also help to build yet another open-source tool on TRON Network.
